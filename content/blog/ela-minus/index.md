A page for musician Ela Minus. This site is an immersive album listening experience, featuring visuals from Dr.Me and Zach Lieberman. From a coding standpoint, there's a bunch of fun things included in this site, but my favorite aspect is the slideshow scroll effect (check it out). It was a lot of fun working with Ela and Pushkar (from Domino records) on this as well. Fast internet connection recommended.
